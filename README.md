Extends weather to change based on season. Limited testing currently (seasons take awhile). Please comment and let me know any feedback about seasonal settings or potential related features.

# Important

**Early release**. Much more desired for this mod but want to hear some user feedback as I continue.

# Features
- Each season has different weather commonalities for each weather type
- All biomes have weather adapted a bit to fit each season. More to come.
- Most biomes are less clear now and I think Jungles in particular will go more in this direction.
- Two new weather types are added Dust and Dry Duststorm
- Growth rates are increased for plants by 20% during rainfall
- Weather Drone has been added (maybe needs a better name). Weather can affect mood in rare cases (like a psychic drone).
- Added Double Rainbow. Rarely after a weather event which contained rain, a double rainbow appears and improves moods.

# Notes

The wildfire event may cause performance issues but is still a rather rare occurence. Another mod is being developed to hopefully address fire performance issues. These are currently included in the NoFirewatcher mod.
